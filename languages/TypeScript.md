# TypeScript

TypeScript should be better called as **Trap**Script ðŸ˜†. The whole idea of `gradually` converting your JS codebase to TS is definitely a trap because it conveys the message that you can take this activity whenever you want. The problem however is that unless you specifically take time out for this activity, you are never going to do it.

And if you are going to take time out for this activity, specifically, then why learn a restrictive language, whose only purpose is to provide type-safety harness for another language? Why not learn a general-purpose, hardcore language like F# or Scala?

Sure, you can use it for the back-end with Node.js but who even uses Node.js ðŸ˜‰

My other big problem with TS is that it advertises itself as a *half-this and half-that* (the whole, gradually adding it in the code-base story) and to me it sounds like **neither-this and nor-that**.

**So, please stay away from it**, and if you really need a `compile-to-JS` language, then there are much better options, like [Re-Script](https://rescript-lang.org/) or [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) (which compiles both to BEAM & JS) or even [F# Fable](https://fable.io/).

If you like TS or have to use it at work, then you must look into [Effect](https://effect.website/) and try learning it and incorporating it in your code-bases.

# Conclusion

It's better to stay away from a restrictive language whose only purpose is to provide stability to another language. ðŸ˜’
