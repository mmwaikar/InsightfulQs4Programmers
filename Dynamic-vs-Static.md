# Dynamic vs. Static typing

That's not even a debate nowadays and it's a **solved problem**. It is amply clear that dynamically typed languages have their limitations. While these languages are good for small projects / teams or maybe scripting, eventually you start hitting those limitations.

## Limitations

- Hard to refactor
- Hard to debug (need to keep a lot of state in head)
- Performance

## But I don't need static typing

Really?

Q1. Then why does [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) exist?
Q2. What's the need for [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)?
