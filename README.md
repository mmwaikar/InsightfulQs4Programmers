# InsightfulQs4Programmers
Insightful Questions which the programmers should ask themselves about different technologies / languages.

The year is 2025 and we cannot be doing the same things which we were doing say, 10 years ago. The world keeps moving forward, AI is permeating every aspect of our life, but sadly, the way we approach software development hasn't changed much.

This is partly due to the fact that companies cannot toss away working software and rewrite everything. Even then, a lot of new projects are conceptualized and being worked upon, but the choice of tools / technlogies, sometimes feels wrong.

These questions will also help developers who are planning to learn new technologies in deciding their merit and possibly eliminating less compelling choices.

That said, let's begin the exploration.

## Languages

| Language | Debut Year | Generics Introduced in |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| Java | 1995 | 2004 |
| [JavaScript](languages/JavaScript.md) | 1995 | 2004 |
| [C#](languages/CSharp.md) | 2000 | 2005 |
| [Go](languages/Go.md) | 2012 | 2022 |
| [TypeScript](languages/TypeScript.md) | 2012 | |
| [Rust](languages/Rust.md) | 2015 |  |

## Conclusion

1. **If** you must use JS, then use either [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Read [A Decade of SolidJS](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/a-decade-of-solidjs-32f4) and how every major framework now uses `Signals` (for fine grained reactivity). Also yu can write web components in Svelte.

2. **If** you must use C#, then please start using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) for browser applications, or [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) or [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) for cross-platform applications.
